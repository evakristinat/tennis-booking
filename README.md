This project was my very first web app built from scratch. It is not pretty since I knew very little of web development back then but it functions pretty nice. 
Check it out!

The app was built as a pairproject with Angular and it's used to book a tennis court. 
It uses Firebase as a database and has a possibility for a Google login.
